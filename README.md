# CESM

This repo is to store a usable copy of the Classification of Education Subject Matter as drafted by the Department of Education.
The shortcode will be used in quite a few ARC projects, and this repo is just to have a single consistent view of it.

## CESM_August2008.pdf
This is the original document from the Department of Education with a complete list of Subject Matters.

## cesm.txt
A simple extract from the pdf containing all the codes and their titles.

## cesm.py
A python script to convert the data in cesm.txt to a usuable json format.

## cesm.json
The actual result of the converstion. We'll include this file in other projects to display a full list of subject matters
